# Personal Resume Builder

A custom resume builder built to stop relying on third-party services and leverage technologies I already know.

## Why I Built This

Got tired of:
- Limited customization in resume builders
- Subscription fees and paywalls
- Not having full control over my data and design

So I built my own using tech I'm already familiar with.

## Features

- **Live JSON Editing** - Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting
- **Real-time Preview** - See changes instantly in iframe
- **PDF Export** - High-quality PDF generation with Puppeteer
- **Custom Layout** - 3-column grid with promotion support
- **Modern Styling** - Clean, compact design optimized for ATS
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety throughout

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Monaco Editor** - Professional code editing
- **Puppeteer** - PDF generation
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Iframe Resizer** - Responsive preview

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start building your resume.

## Usage

1. Edit your resume data in the JSON panel
2. See live preview in the right panel
3. Click "Export PDF" for high-quality output

That's it. No subscriptions, no limits, just a resume builder that works exactly how I want it to.
